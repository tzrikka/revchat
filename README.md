RevChat creates a seamless integration between developer platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) and instant messaging platforms (such as Slack and Discord) to streamline code reviews and cut down turnaround time.

It is a free and open-source solution that provides:

- Real-time, relevant, informative, 2-way updates
- Easier collaboration and faster execution

No more:

- Delays due to missed requests, unnoticed comments, and state changes latency
- Notification fatigue due to a firehose of updates that don't concern you
- Questions like "Who's turn is it" or "What should I do now"
