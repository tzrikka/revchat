RevChat creates a seamless integration between Source Code Management platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) and Instant Messaging platforms (such as Slack and Discord) to streamline code reviews and reduce the time to merge.

It automatically manages dedicated channels for each pull/merge request, and nudges the relevant participants if they haven't responded to the latest activity.

It is a free and open-source solution that provides:

- Real-time, relevant, informative, 2-way updates and discussions
- Easier collaboration and faster execution for teams of any size

No more:

- Delays due to unnoticed comments and asynchronous state changes
- Notification fatigue due to a firehose of details without context
- Questions like "Whose turn is it?" or "When should I look at this again?"
